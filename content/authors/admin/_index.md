Hi!

I am a software developer, consultant, computer scientist, and compulsive tinkerer. I'm especially interested in the world of tangible-computation, that is, the use of computers and mathematics to create things that you can see, touch, or hear (smell and taste are a bit trickier).

I recently graduated with an M.Sc from the [DGP](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/) at the University of Toronto advised by [Alec Jacobson](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/) and [David Levin](http://diwlevin.webfactional.com/researchdb/#research). I've also spent several years as a software developer on large-scale projects at [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com), [Autodesk Research](https://autodeskresearch.com/), and [LinkedIn](linkedin.com).

You can find my full CV [here](/files/cv.pdf).
